# Task-2-Employee-Master
BEINEX Python + Django


Design a small Employee web application using Python/Django framework with below requirements.
1. Application should have authorization. Use admin/admin123 as password to access the URL of web 
application.
2. Design an employee table in MySQL database: Approx. columns fields should be:
▪ ID (auto generated or use sequence number)
▪ Employee name
▪ Image as a blob
▪ Email
▪ Password
▪ Phone#
▪ Address
▪ Feel free to add any others if you wish so
3. Two other pages:
▪ Add Employee (We can create an employee)
▪ View Employees (View the employee data + his image) – In a grid or Once
added Employee he/she can access the portal with his/her Email / Password fields – which is currently 
hardcoded by Admin (that’s ok).
